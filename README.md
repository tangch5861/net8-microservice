### Running a .NET Microservices Project in VS Code

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install the latest version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) if the project depends on it.
   - Install **Visual Studio Code** and add the C# extension.

2. **Open the Project in VS Code**
   - Extract the project files to a working directory.
   - Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Use `File > Open Folder` to open the root directory of the project.

3. **Verify Solution and Project Files**
   - Check for the `.sln` (solution) file in the root folder. If it exists, open it by running:
     ```sh
     dotnet build
     ```
   - If thereâ€™s no solution file, ensure each service (e.g., `AuthService`, `UserProfileService`) has a `.csproj` file.

4. **Restore Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the root of each service folder (e.g., `AuthService`, `UserProfileService`) and restore dependencies:
     ```sh
     dotnet restore
     ```

5. **Database Configuration**
   - Open `appsettings.json` for each service that uses a database.
   - Update the PostgreSQL connection string with your local database credentials:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
         "PostgresConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=yourdb;Username=yourusername;Password=yourpassword"
     }
     ```

6. **Run Individual Services**
   - To run a specific service (e.g., `AuthService`), navigate to its folder and execute:
     ```sh
     dotnet run
     ```
   - Repeat this for each service you want to test.

7. **Running All Services**
   - If the project uses Docker, check for a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory.
   - Start all services using Docker:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up
     ```

8. **Testing APIs**
   - Use **Postman** to test each API endpoint.
   - For JWT authentication:
     1. Call the `/login` endpoint in `AuthService` to retrieve a token.
     2. Pass the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for other service calls.

9. **Debugging in VS Code**
   - Open the `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder to configure debugging for each service.
   - Set breakpoints in `Program.cs` or any other file for step-by-step debugging.
